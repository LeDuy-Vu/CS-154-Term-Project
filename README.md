# CS-154-Term-Project
For the term project from my Formal Languages and Computability class, our team of 3 designed and implemented a Universal Turing Machine that simulates running any arbitrary first in-first out automata again any arbitrary string. We used JFLAP 7.1 to develop, run, and test the whole project. To run the project file, you can download the latest version of JFLAP here: http://www.jflap.org/jflaptmp/
Big thanks to my teammates Fariba Asaadi and Roya Torshizi, as well as my teacher Ahmad Yazdankhah. I had a tough but memorable first semester at SJSU :)
